# 1st interview with parent company

## interview atmosphere

I had to leave early in the morning for the interview. Watching it earlier than going to work means I have to spend half of my stamina even on the way to work because I live in a rural area. This is an opportunity to inform myself at my discretion, so I have to bear these inconveniences, but I cannot deny that it is difficult.

The interview was the first in my life `다대다`. Even I had no experience with formal interviews, so my head was blank. (I remember that my previous job was over after listening to the boss’s son)

## interview questions

There were no such difficult questions, but of course, it was difficult for me because I was not prepared. I couldn't even attach the portfolio I had made as a file, and I found out during the interview, so inside I was so embarrassed that my hair turned white.

To be honest, the questions were largely about self-introduction , project -related questions , coding test - related questions, and self-development questions.

I thought the self-introduction was going to end with just who I am, but it was the second turn of misfortunes among my misfortunes. Looking at the interviewers, I didn't think a long self-introduction would be appealing to me, so I thought, 'Let's keep it as concise as possible and let us know what you're doing' and the self-introduction was over.

Needless to say, the project was an interview that had already been conducted without Popol attached, so I thought it was ruined and talked about what I did slowly. Of course, I also couldn't practice speaking, no, I didn't. I thought that only CS questions would come up, but I was only looking at CS... To summarize what the applicants said when answering project questions, what functions were used to process data, where to receive data, and to whom. I remember talking about including the process of "I just have a certain function. When I press a button, something becomes scrap." It ended with a very, very, very, very, very sad and regretful. Project-related questions are broadly categorized as follows.

- Why was this project created? (for what purpose it was made)
- How many people participate in the project?
- I remember this far
